This is a list of some of the past funded and unfunded research that I have worked on.

# TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS AND IMPACT ON WORK
My early work in understanding information systems and tools in healthcare work systems led to an investigation of the role information plays in the design of work tools in cognitive work systems, and in keeping the work system self-organized and robust.  Further, what role do the people in the system play in keeping the work system orderly? My investigations were supported by a 5-year grant (NIH equivalent of an NSF-CAREER grant funded for $768,528) from the National Library of Medicine (NLM-NIH) as detailed in the next section.  

*Technology, Cognitive Work and Patient Safety: An Information-Oriented Model (K99/R00), 9/1/2012-8/31/2017, Funding Source: National Library of Medicine, Role: PI*

### Project Goals
My project focuses on understanding how, why and what information people create, use and share in a system to facilitate goal achievement and work performance, and how designers can effectively use that knowledge about peopleâ€™s interaction with information for designing information systems. Additionally, my research highlights the nature, form, and attributes of health information, and the tools and technologies health providers use as cognitive supports for their patient care tasks. My specific aims were:

Specific Aim 1: To model the discharge process flow where providers create and use low-level information, I would map major discharge process events depicting patient and discharge process state changes. I would qualitatively analyze provider interviews and focus group data.

Specific Aim 2: To identify low-level information attributes of major discharge process events and relate them to workarounds and medical error, I would use the information-based work design technique to tag the discharge process flow map developed in an earlier K99 grant (that I received also from NLM-NIH) phase with: (a) low-level information providers create and use for discharge from provider observations, shadowing and interviews; (b) past and potential errors from adverse-events data, care provider interviews; and (c) provider developed strategies and workarounds. 

Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate utility of low-level information pieces as design bases for cognitive work support, I would test two research interventions: (1) design an information-action interface with information pieces and associated properties, and test situation awareness of providers with the new interface; (2) augment selected existing IT support in the discharge process with new low-level information-based design features from my work to see if workarounds are reduced.

### Importance of the Problem
One in three patients in the US are likely to experience a medical error. Estimates of adverse events now are ten times more than what IOM predicted ten years ago. Inadequate information support is the second major cause for medical errors and adverse drug events. A lack of timely access to critical patient information, information lost in communication, poor information sharing and transfer provisions, lack of interoperability between information sources, and poor support for provider information needs, all cause problems for safe care, and heighten the need to reevaluate how we design, operate and maintain information support systems. Managing information for safe care, especially in the new EHR environment, continues to be cognitively challenging for care providers. A recent report from an NRC Committee on Engaging the Computer Science Research in Health Care Informatics concludes that healthcare work is knowledge intensive, and that health IT systems must adequately support cognitive work of providers.

### Project overview
I developed an information trail model that tracks information as it is created, used and managed by people. The model captures 16 characteristics of information and models the flow of information across a system based on theories of complexity and self-organization. With this model, I have extended my work to understand information that healthcare providers create, use and manage. The model helps the medical community [both researchers and practitioners] understand how and what information health providers create and use, and how that information is integrated and shared among the different providers. I developed a prototype for representing information content and form in a novel way to best support provider needs and conducted experiments to assess usability and situation awareness.
