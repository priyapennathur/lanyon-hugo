I am a tenured Associate Professor in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Iowa. Prior to my work at the University of Iowa, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins University. I received my PhD in Industrial Engineering from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo. My BS degree is in Computer Science from the University of Madras, India.

My primary research interests are in studying peopleâ€™s cognitive work and in designing information systems to support their cognitive work. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Library of Medicine at NIH. 

In a recent NSF project funded in 2020, I am modeling nurses' decision making when tele-triaging during the pandemic.I have also received an NSF grant in September 2021 to study the how artificial intelligence will impact office work and workers.  

An allied research interest I have is in understanding barriers to creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive educational environment for underrepresented minority students in engineering.  In a 2021 NSF grant I have received (in collaboration with Dr. A. Pennathur), I am examining social and technical factors that will catalyze the success of these students.   

Previously, I have led and participated in many federally-funded research projects examining various aspects of cognitive work in healthcare settings including situation awareness and communication when transitioning from manual to electronic patient tracking systems, developing models of information-based cognitive work representations for healthcare providers, cognitive work in pain management, and improving patient safety and the quality of care. In my work, I employ a variety of research approaches and methods such as field simulations, observations, interviews, and qualitative and quantitative analyses.

I am presently a Scientific Editor in [Applied Ergonomics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/applied-ergonomics) and an Associate Editor in [IISE Transactions on Healthcare Systems Engineering](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/uhse21/current). I also serve on the Editorial Board in [Human Factors in Healthcare](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/human-factors-in-healthcare), and [International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-industrial-ergonomics/editorial-board). I serve as a reviewer in many research journals including [Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-industrial-ergonomics/editorial-board). I continue to serve as an NSF panelist for many NSF programs. 

I am also the Director of Graduate Studies in my department. I have served on the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council in the University of Iowa College of Engineering between 2019-2021, and presently serve as a faculty search advocate for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion as a part of the Path to Distinction Program at the University.
