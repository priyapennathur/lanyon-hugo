I am an associate professor in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the University of Iowa. I have a doctoral degree in Industrial Engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo, a Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso, a Masters and Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Madras, India. 

I am a human factors engineer and have specific expertise in cognitive engineering. My work is focused on studying cognitive work and designing information systems to support cognitive work. Majority of my research has been in the field of healthcare. While pursuing my doctorate at the University of Buffalo, I have participated in federally-funded (NLM, AHRQ) research projects showing that transitioning from manual to electronic patient tracking systems significantly affected the situational awareness and communication of care providers in emergency departments. In my doctoral dissertation, I developed and piloted an information-based work design and analysis technique to capture and represent the work of healthcare providers. As a post-doctoral research fellow at the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins, I applied my engineering knowledge and skills to numerous patient safety-related projects while acquiring expertise in interdisciplinary, team-based patient safety research. I have collaborated on several extramurally-funded research projects that apply human factors engineering to improve the quality of care. These projects range from understanding the information needs of health care providers to identifying the challenges of pain management. Recently, I have been working on understanding nurses' decision making constraints when tele-triaging during a pandemic. I have begun working in the fields of engineering education and DEI. I am partnering with my brother Dr. Arun Pennathur to study engineering education related questions on diversity, equity and inclusion for URM students. I am excited to begin a new project on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Work (more on that soon). I have employed a variety of research methods such as field simulations, observations, interviews, and human factors engineering analyses to contribute my expertise to these studies.

I am a scientific editor in [Applied Ergonomics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/applied-ergonomics) and an associate editor in [IISE Transactions on Healthcare Systems Engineering](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/uhse21/current). I serve as an editorial board member in [Human Factors in Healthcare](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/human-factors-in-healthcare), and [International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-industrial-ergonomics/editorial-board) and a reviewer in many journals including [Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-industrial-ergonomics/editorial-board).

I currently serve as the Director of Graduate Studies in my deparment. I served on the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council in the College of Engineering between 2019-2021, and currently serve as a faculty search advocate for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion as a part of the Path to Distinction Program.
